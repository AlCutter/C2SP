# Community Cryptography Specification Project

## Versioning

All specifications use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Since this is normally
intended for software, we adapt it to our specifications with the following semantics:

- 0.Y.Z indicates draft specifications.
  - Bump the version as often as you need!
  - Always bump the minor version on any material change.
- 1.Y.Z indicates "final" specifications, but these are not set in stone.
  - At this point a specification's meaning should not change.
  - Bump the patch version when making changes to the text of a specification (to improve
    it, or fix errata).
  - An extension could be defined in a separate specification, and the "main"
    specification's minor version would be incremented to include the extension.
- 2.Y.Z and above will ideally never be needed! But if we make a mistake in a finalised
  specification, this would be the pathway to recovery.
  - Otherwise these are identical to 1.Y.Z.
